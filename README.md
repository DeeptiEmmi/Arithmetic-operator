# Arithmetic-operator
## Experiment 2
### AIM: 
To use arithmetic operators and add two numbers

### THEORY:
Airthmetic operators are symbols used in programming to perform operations on variables and values. They are important to writing expressions and making decisions in code.
Used for basic math operations, including +, -, *, /, and %.

### TYPES:
#### Addition (+): Adds two operands. 
Example: a + b 
#### Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first. 
Example: a - b 
#### Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
Example: a * b 
#### Division (/): Divides the numerator by the denominator.
Example: a / b
#### Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of a division operation.
Example: a % b
